Measurements and Data

Introduction
============

There are four techniques for observing chargeability: two using a charging current that is turned abruptly off so that discharging can be observed in the time domain, and two in which the dispersive nature (or effect as a function of frequency) of the phenomenon is observed in the frequency domain.

Two types of time domain data
=============================
Consider the experiment illustrated in the following figure. Current is injected into the ground at the \\(I\\) source electrodes and voltage is measured at the \\(V\\) potential electrodes. The source is DC (direct current) in the sense that when it is on, there is no variation. However, in this case it is turned on and off with a duty cycle as shown in the figure. Two methods of measuring chargeability in the time domain are described below.
