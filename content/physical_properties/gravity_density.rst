Density
*******

Some Definitions
================

For gravity survey, the physical property of concern is density. A densier buried object would create an higher attraction than the background. A hole, with a density of 0, would create a lower attraction than the background. Difference of densities in the subsurface can be mapped by measuring the variations of the earth gravity field.

Density is defined as the ratio between the weight of an object and its volume.

	\rho = \frac{M}{V}
