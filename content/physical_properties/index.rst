This section covers some of the basic information regarding rocks physical properties. 

For magnetic surveys, the physical property of concern is magnetic susceptibility, which is a measure of how magnetized a material becomes in the presence of a magnetic field. The source for a magnetic field survey is the natural magnetic field of the earth.
