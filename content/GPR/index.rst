Ground Penetrating Radar
========================

Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is an electromagnetic method used to characterize very near surface structures; i.e. depths on the order of a few meters.
It is sometimes referred to as echo-sounding.
GPR exploits contrasts in the Earth's electromagnetic properties in order to define the physical boundaries of shallow structures.
Physical properties important to GPR include: dielectric permittivity, electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability.
Ground penetrating radar is used for a variety of applications.
These include:

	- Mapping the thickness of peat-bogs and other sedimentary layers
	- Obtaining the depth to groundwater or permafrost
	- Locating buried infrastructure such as irrigation pipes, tunnels, electrical wires
	- Finding landmines and unexploded ordnance


During GPR surveys, a source is used to send a pulse of high-frequency electromagnetic waves (or radiowaves) into the ground.
As the radiowaves propagate through the Earth, they are distorted as a result of the Earth's electromagnetic properties.
At boundaries where the Earth's electromagnetic properties change abruptly, radiowave signals may undergo transmission, reflection and/or refraction.
Because of this, much of the understanding of seismic methods can be applied to ground penetrating radar.
Sensors at the Earth's surface measure the amplitudes and travel times of the distorted radiowave signals.
These data are then processed and interpreted.

In this section we will look at aspects of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR).
Radio waves are the source energy for GPR and the physical properties that we
consider are dielectric permittivity, electrical conductivity and magnetic
permeability. Even though the sources and material properties appear different
than the previous section, GPR data show the reflection and transmission of
waves, and therefore the mathematics and plots are remarkably similar to
seismic waves.
