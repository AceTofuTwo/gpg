Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is an electromagnetic method used for very near surface exploration; i.e. depths on the order of a few meters.
It is sometimes referred to as echo-sounding.
GPR exploits contrasts in electromagnetic properties in order to define the physical boundaries of shallow structures (both natural and man-made).
Physical properties important to GPR include: dielectric permittivity, electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability.
Ground penetrating radar is used for a variety of applications.
These include:

	- Investigating concrete structures and roads
	- Mapping the thickness of peat-bogs and other sedimentary layers
	- Obtaining the depth to groundwater or permafrost
	- Locating buried infrastructure such as irrigation pipes, tunnels and electrical wires
	- Finding landmines and unexploded ordnance

During GPR surveys, a source (:math:`Tx`) is used to send a pulse of high-frequency electromagnetic waves (radiowaves) into the ground.
As the radiowaves propagate through the Earth, they are distorted as a result of the Earth's electromagnetic properties.
At boundaries where the subsurface electromagnetic properties change abruptly, radiowave signals may undergo transmission, reflection and/or refraction.
Because of this, much of the understanding of seismic methods can be applied to ground penetrating radar.

Sensors (:math:`Rx`) at the Earth's surface measure the amplitudes and travel times of the distorted radiowave signals that return to the surface.
These data are amalgamated and represented using a radargram.
The horizontal axis (distance) is used to represent the location of the receiver relative to the source for a particular sounding.
The vertical axis shows the amplitude of the measured signal as a function of time.
It is from radargrams that we will do the majority of our interpretation of GPR data.
