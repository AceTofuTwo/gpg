In this section we will look at aspects of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR).
Radio waves are the source energy for GPR and the physical properties that we
consider are dielectric permittivity, electrical conductivity and magnetic
permeability. Even though the sources and material properties appear different
than the previous section, GPR data show the reflection and transmission of
waves, and therefore the mathematics and plots are remarkably similar to
seismic waves.
