Diagnostic Physical Properties
******************************


Unlike the survey methods discussed previously, signals corresponding to ground penetrating radar (GPR) depend on a multitude of physical properties.
The most important physical property to GPR is the :ref:`dielectric permittivity<physical_properties_dielectric_permittivity>` (:math:`\varepsilon`), as it greatly influences the velocity, attenuation, reflection, refraction and transmission of radiowaves.
These concepts will be presented in the following section.
In addition to the dielectric permittivity, the propagation of radiowaves through the Earth may depend significantly on the :ref:`electrical conductivity<physical_properties_conductivity>` (:math:`\sigma`); provided the electrical conductivity of the Earth is sufficiently large.
If the Earth is magnetic, we may also need to consider the role of :ref:`magnetic permeability<physprop_mag_susc>` (:math:`\mu`).

For simple cases, it is generally assumed that the effects of electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability on radiowave propagation are minimal.
As a result, the fundamental understanding of ground penetrating radar can be more or less understood by considering subsurface variations in the Earth's dielectric permittivity.
It is important to note however, that electrical conductivity plays an important role in characterizing the attenuation of radio waves as well as determining the penetration depth of GPR systems.
