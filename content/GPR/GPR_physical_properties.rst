Diagnostic Physical Properties
******************************


Unlike the survey methods we have discussed before, signals corresponding to ground penetrating radar (GPR) depend on a multitude of physical properties.
The most important physical property to GPR is the dielectric permittivity (link); as it influences the velocity, attenuation, reflection, refraction and transmission of the GPR signal.
Dielectric permittivity (:math:`\varepsilon`) defines how strongly a material becomes polarized when an electric field is applied.
This relationship is given by:

.. math::
	\vec D = \varepsilon \vec E
	
where :math:`\vec E` is the electric field and :math:`\vec D` is the electric displacement.
