Survey and Data
***************

Here, we discuss the various survey geometries used in GPR and some of their applications.
Depending of the goal or the GPR survey, certain configurations may be more effective.
Furthermore, interpretation of GPR data is made significantly easier by using an appropriate survey configuration.

On this page we will learn about...


Common Survey Geometries
========================

Introduction

	        Several applications for transillumination survey configuration. (A) Mine-shaft structural integrity (B) Borehole survey. (C) Concrete pillar testing.



Common offset surveys are the most frequently used configuration for GPR surveys.
In common offset survey, the distance between the transmitter and a single receiver is fixed.
Data are collected each time the transmitter-receiver pair are moved to a new position.
In some cases, the transmitter and receiver are placed at a zero-offset; otherwise known as a coincident source and receiver.

As we will show in the interpretation section, common-offset surveys are effective for locating the depths of near-horizontal interfaces.
In addition, zero-offset surveys are very affective a locating compact buried objects; as they generate hyperbolic signatures in radargram data.




**Common Midpoint Survey**



For this configuration, the distance between the transmitter and receiver are changed for every reading.
However, the halfway point between the transmitter and the receiver is kept the same.





**Transillumination Survey**




When performing a transillumination GPR survey, multiple transmitters and receivers are placed on either side of an region of interest.
Transillumination surveys can be used in testing concrete structure and evaluating mines.





Source Signal
=============

As we have already discussed, the source attena sends a pulse of radiowaves into the ground.
This pulse however, is not made up entirely of radiowaves of a single frequency.
Instead, a modulated set of sinusoidal waves are used create a wavelet.
The wavelet contains information over a range of frequencies 







Instead, it is **wavelet** comprised of a set of sinusoidal waves with a **central frequency**.
The set of sinusoidal radiowaves produces a **wavelet**.
We use **bandwidth** to define the range of frequencies present in the source pulse.
