Interpretation
**************

In this section, we use a real-world example of an industrial site reclamation to illustrate the use of electromagnetic (EM) methods. In this case study, the interpretation of EM data had proven useful in characterizing the sub-surface in the search of underground contaminants.


Background
==========

The field site in question is an urban area with a complex industrial history located near downtown Vancouver, Canada.

 which is about to be cleaned up prior to construction of public space.

There are many questions about the subsurface which can be addressed using geophysical surveys. Examples include:

- What is the thickness of the mixed fill layer (i.e. what is the depth to till)?

 - What is the distribution of buried objects? Many objects are thought to exist, possibly ranging in size from small pieces of industrial trash, to railway lines, reinforced concrete building foundations, and buried tanks.

 - Can geophysics contribute any information about the extent of hydrocarbons within the top layer, which consists of a wide range of fill materials?

 -Where is fill material dominated by wood waste, making ground unfit to support structures?


Finally, it is worth noting that the actual field site was fully remediated by the end of 1991, as summarized by the closure report prepared by Golder Associates Ltd. (Soils and Remediation Group), May 1992. For a brief discussion of some of the remediation work actually carried out at this site, see the additional information on hydrocarbons after the contractor's report
