Responses from a Conductor in Free Space
****************************************

The above plots, and the basic understanding of the different coupling between
the source and receiver that is due to geometry, allows us to sketch the
expected responses that arise from a frequency domain horizontal loop survey
taken over a conductor which is buried in a resistive host. This is a two-
stage process.

1. Use the geometries of the source and receiver to sketch the characteristic
   curve. 
2. Use the response diagram and the knowledge of whether you are
   dealing with a good conductor or poor conductor to determine the relative
   amplitude of the in-phase and out-of-phase parts.


**Part I:** Consider the basic geometry given below. For any placement of the
transmitter there will be a varying magnetic field crossing the plate and
hence induced currents. Those currents generate secondary magnetic fields.
Adopt a convention that if the secondary field is in (he same direction as
the primary field then the response will be plotted as a positive value.
Alternatively, when the two fields are in opposition the response will be
negative. The distance between the transmitter and receiver loops is held
fixed and the-datum is plotted at the midpoint between the coils. When both
loops are to the left, or to the right, of the plate then the response is
positive. The response will be zero when either coil is over the plate. When
the receiver, which is a horizontal coil, is over the plate, then no
magnetic flux is passing through the coil. There will be zero voltage
induced. When the transmitter is directly over the thin conducting plate,
there is no flux crossing the plate, hence no currents will be generated in
the plate and the secondary magnetic field is zero.

**Part II:** The basic sketch for the shape of the anomalous signal is
determined from the geometry of the coils and the relative locations of
transmitter, receiver and the conductive body. In practice we measure both an
in-phase and an out-of-phase component. Each of these curves will look like
the basic curve (given above). We need only establish relative amplitude. From
the general response curve we find that the in-phase (or real component) is
larger than the out-of-phase (imaginary) component when \\(\\omega \\sigma \\)
(or \\(\\omega L / R\\)) is large.

Below we plot the responses for a horizontal loop survey taken over a vertical
conductive plate in which:

1.  strike length of the plate: S = 1.0 units
2.  width of the plate W= 0.5 units (length in vertical extent)
3.  depth of burial Z=0.13 units
4.  L=distance between source and transmitter coil L=0.76 units (Z/L=0.17)
5.  conductivity-thickness product = 1.0

Because the body is conductive and the frequency of the survey is high, the
value of \\(\\omega L / R\\) is large and the in-phase response is larger than
the quadrature response.
