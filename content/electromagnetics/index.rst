In this section, we look at electromagnetic (EM) methods. The source in an electromagnetic survey is a transmitter that generates a time-varying current. A receiver can measure the magnetic field and/or electric field generated by this current as well as secondary fields induced by objects in the field of the source. There are several important concepts and physical laws involved in understanding EM methods, including apparent conductivity, magnetic flux, Lens’ Law, Faraday’s Law, and Ohm’s Law. The first section below explains the basic principles in an EM survey, and the second section focuses on frequency-domain techniques.
