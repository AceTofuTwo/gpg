Conductive Host
===============

The sketches regarding EM responses were derived under the simplifying
assumptions that the buried body was in a very resistive medium. Consequently,
the response depended only upon the relative orientations of the source coil
and the body (the coupling effect), the conductivity of the body and the
frequency of the transmitter, and the coupling effect of the secondary
magnetic fields with the receiver.

In more realistic situations the object of interest in buried in a conductive
medium.

The laws of EM induction require that there be eddy currents that are also set
up in the host. But any conductive material in which currents are flowing is a
"lossy" medium. That is, there are :math:`I^2R` losses which convert the
electromagnetic energy to heat. As a consequence the energy from the source
does not propagate to arbitrarily large depths in the earth. The amplitude of
the EM fields thus decrease due to geometrical spreading and attenuation.
