This chapter provides non-technical introductions to essential concepts underlying applied geophysics. Material is quite varied, and should be useful to beginners as well as experienced geophysicists. See also the Resources/References section for other useful background material about applied geophysics. Sections in "Foundations" include:

 a. **Contents** (this page)
 b. **Sumary pages**
 	1. **7-step Framework** A summary explainnig the seven-step framework for applying geophysics.
 	2. **Survey methods:** Short 1-paragraph outlines of most geophysical survey methods.
 	3. **Model types:** Summaries explaining 1D, 2D, 3D and other model types. 
 c. **Seeing the subsurface**: An introductory article about geophysics and geophysical inversion.
 d. **Physical properties**: Some basic material regarding how physical properties depend upon geological materials. Properties covered include
 	1. electrical conductivity
 	2. chargeability
 	3. magnetic susceptibility
 	4. density
 	5. seismic velocity
 	6. dielectric permittivity
 e. **Plotting**: An introduction to some considerations regarding plotting colour contour maps. 
 f. **Signals:** Some preliminary remarks about data, signals, digital sampling and noise.
