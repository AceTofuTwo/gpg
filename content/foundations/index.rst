This section covers the basic ideas governing geophysical exploration. First we look at a seven-step framework that offers a logical sequence for carrying out geophysical surveys. Next, we will take an overview of some of the available methods used in geophysics, then we consider some mathematical representations of the earth. Last, we look at a multi-part section, “Seeing Underground,” where we discuss physical properties, ways we represent data through inversion, and look at some examples.
