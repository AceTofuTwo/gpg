This section covers the basic ideas governing the application of geophysics to helping solve problems in the geosciences. First present  a seven-step framework that offers a logical sequence for using geophysics. Next, we will take an overview of some of the available methods used in geophysics and  consider mathematical representations of the earth. In  “Seeing Underground,”  we discuss physical properties, ways we represent data through inversion, and look at some examples.
