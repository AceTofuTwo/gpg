		Pages have been duplicates due to a problem with the navbar on the website. The students were sent to the original page and so were leaving the "foundations" chapter. This solution is meant to be temporary until a more suitable one have been found.	

	all duplicates images have been stored in ./images/images_duplicates/. This choice has been made to ensure that any displacement of the physical properties section would not require (as it happened before) to relocate all images links.
