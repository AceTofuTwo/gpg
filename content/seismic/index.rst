In this section we will give a brief introduction to applied seismology, starting with the fundamental physics that underly all seismic methods and moving on to the basics of artificial source seismic refraction and reflection methods.

Seismic methods involve generating elastic energy that propagates through the ground. Sensors (geophones) are installed
in lines on the surface, and they record the faint ground motions that return from boundaries where the
elastic properties of subsurface materials change. At such boundaries there
are two fundamental physical effects--reflection and refraction. Some of the energy from a seismic wave impinging on an interface will be bounced back, or reflected, toward the surface--
light reflecting from a semi-transparent mirror is a good analogy. Refraction is less intuitive, but the concept is recognizable in images of
objects under water. When light arrives at a boundary, the portion that passes
through is bent so its direction of propagation changes. In fact, seismic
refraction involves detecting energy that has been bent so that it travels
along the interface between two subsurface materials, before returning to the
surface where its effects can be measured. The phenomenon is not intuitive,
but it is explained in the "Ray paths" section of this chapter.

There are far more professional geophysicists employed in the seismic industry
than any other branch of applied geophysics. Most are working at seismic
reflection in its many forms for the oil/gas exploration industries. Some
mineral exploration companies have recently used 3D seismic reflection
surveying to help delineate known ore bodies but it is
not universally used. The geotechnical and environmental industries use
seismic refraction regularly to efficiently assess layer thicknesses and
mechanical properties in the top few 10s of meters of the subsurface. Seismic reflection has
more recently become economical for shallow work (from roughly five meters depth,
down to hundreds of meters).
