Seismic Reflection

In this section we will continue from the seismic refraction section and look
at the behavior of reflected waves. We will cover reflection and transmission
coefficients, impedance, and the vertical resolution that we can achieve using
reflection information. A key concept to this section is the travel time
curve, which is used to get velocity and layer depth information from field
data. Additional topics that we will cover include ways that we improve the
signal in the measured data (fold and stacking), techniques to filter data
(filtering), and methods to correct our data to obtain true versus apparent
reflections (migration).
