Multichannel Reflection Survey
******************************

First consider the source-receiver geometry. The geometry can be "split
spread" in which case there is a central shot with receivers on both sides, or
a "single-ended spread" in which the receivers are always on one side of the
source. Split spreads are common in land surveys; single-ended spreads are
common in marine surveys.

.. <<editorial comment>> The original GPG had a "click to enlarge" feature for the shot gather. Should it be added?

A split spread seismic record is shown above. The seismic traces all belong to
a single source and hence this is referred to as a "Common Source Gather". The
first arrivals are direct or critically refracted arrivals. Reflection
hyperbolae from numerous boundaries are observed, right. The strong energy in
the triangular central portion is ground roll caused by surface waves. It
masks the reflection events.
