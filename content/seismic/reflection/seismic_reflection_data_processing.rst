Data processing
***************

In order to benefit from gathering several echoes from each reflecting point
there are numerous operations that need to be applied to the data. Much of the
data processing is tied to the hypothesis that the earth's properties vary
most strongly in the vertical direction. The following points illustrate the
fundamental procedural concept underlying the creation of a final seismic
reflection section:
