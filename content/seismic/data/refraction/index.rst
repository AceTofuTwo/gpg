In this chapter we will give a brief introduction to seismic refraction surveying, focusing on near-surface investigations. We will use the ray path model to examine how refracted waves appear in seismic data. We will consider how rays travel in layered media and examine some the variations that occur with more complex geometries such as dipping layers.

... In this chapter we will concentrate seismic refraction for near surface
investigations. Seismic refraction is most useful when the velocity of seismic
signals in each layer increases with depth. Therefore, where higher velocity
(e.g. clay) layers may overlie lower velocity (e.g. sand or gravel) layers,
seismic refraction may yield incorrect results. In addition, seismic
refraction requires geophone arrays with lengths of approximately 4 to 5 times
the depth to the layer of interest (for example the top of bedrock). Therefore
seismic refraction is commonly limited to mapping layers to depths less than
30-50 meters. Greater depths are possible, but the required array lengths may
exceed site dimensions, and the shot energy required to transmit seismic
arrivals for the required distances may necessitate the use of large explosive
charges.
