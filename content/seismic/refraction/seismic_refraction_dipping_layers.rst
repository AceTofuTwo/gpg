Interpretation when layers are dipping
**************************************

Earth layers can often be approximated as planar, but they are rarely horizontal.  The next level of complication is to assume that the layers have some dip associated with them. Consider a single interface which is dipping at an angle [theta] with respect to the horizontal. The critical angle is still defined by the angle that an incoming wave must make with respect to the **normal** of the refractor. This is shown by the left diagram below.
