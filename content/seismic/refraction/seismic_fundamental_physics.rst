Fundamental Physics of Seismology
=================================

If we strike the earth with a hammer, an explosive charge, or an earthquake, the material of the earth near the source becomes compressed (or extended) and twisted. Earth materials are elastic and these deformations propagate away from the source. The speed of propagation and the type of motion propagated depends upon the elastic properties of the material, namely

1. density: \\( \\rho \\)
2. bulk modulus:  \\( \\kappa \\) (compressibility)
3. shear modulus:  \\( \\mu \\) (twistability)

By knowing the time at which the source occurred, and by measuring the travel time that it takes for the various waves to arrive at a receiver, it is possible to obtain information about the velocity and density of the material. This information is then used to provide information about structure and rock type.


Applications of Seismic Surveying
=================================

1. delineation of sedimentary layers
2. determination of depth to bedrock, and topography of the
3. bedrock horizon
4. locating faults
5. large scale structure of earth (using earthquakes)
6. characterization of near surface material properties.


Stress
======

When an external force is applied to a body, there are balanced internal forces set up within the body. Stress is a measure of these internal forces. Units are "force per unit area" or N/m\\(^2\\ . There are two types of stress:

Stress can be **normal** to the surface it is applied on, and hence **compressive** or **tensile** (top figures).


Stress can be **parallel** to the surface. This is **shear** stress (bottom figure)


Strain
======

If a body is stressed it will undergo a change in size and shape. The body is **strained**. If the strains are small then the body will recover its original shape when the stress is removed. This is **elastic strain**. If the strain is too great so that the **yield strength** is exceeded, then the body deforms **plastically** and may ultimately fracture. Plastic strain is not recoverable.
