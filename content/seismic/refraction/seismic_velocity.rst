Seismic Velocity
****************

Relating geology to velocity
============================


The velocities of various rock types vary rather widely, so it is usually difficult to determine rock type based only upon velocities.
The table to the right shows rough ranges of velocities in units of kilometers per second for several types of earth materials.

.. This next sentence is out of place and unsupported: "Therefore" is the major issue

Therefore seismic surveys are most effective at delineating structure, .i.e boundaries where rock type changes.

The relations between elastic properties and velocity,

	v_p = \sqrt{\frac{K+4/3\mu}{\rho}} \quad v_s = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\rho}}
