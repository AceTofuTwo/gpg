Relating geology to velocity
****************************


The velocities of various rock types vary rather widely so it is usually difficult to determine rock type based only upon velocities. The
table to the right shows rough ranges of velocities in units of kilometers per second for several types of earth materials. Therefore seismic
surveys are most effective at delineating structure, .i.e boundaries where rock type changes.
