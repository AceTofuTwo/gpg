Seismic Fundamentals
====================

The energy from a seismic source is travels via different waves. The speed and particle motion of the different waves depends upon the material properties like bulk modulus, shear modulus, and density. The types of waves generated depends upon the source and the receivers can measure acceleration or velocity of the material to which it is attached.
