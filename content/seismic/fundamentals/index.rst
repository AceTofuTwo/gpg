Seismic Fundamentals
====================

In this section we will go over some of the fundamental physics of acoustic
waves (two types, referred to as P and S waves) and their relationship to
material properties like bulk modulus, shear modulus, and density. We will
then introduce a simplified model that describes sound waves as ray-paths, which we will use to study how refracted and reflected waves appear in seismic data.
