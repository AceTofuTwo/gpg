Seismic Fundamentals
====================

In this section we will go over some of the fundamental physics of acoustic
waves (two types, referred to as P and S waves) and their relationship to
material properties like bulk modulus, shear modulus, and density. We will
then use a conceptual model that describes sound waves as ray-paths and
examine how refracted waves appear in seismic data. Last we will consider how
rays travel in layered media and examine some the variations that occur with
different geometries, like dipping layers and horizontal velocity variations.
