Seismic Sources
***************

For seismic surveying purposes there are a number of generic goals. Not all of these objectives can be met perfectly, but sources are designed to meet them as effectively as possible.

1. High energy is required--the stronger the source, the better the signal to noise ratio.

2. High frequency is preferred--the higher the frequency, the shorter the seismic pulse and hence the better the resolution.

3. Repeatability is important for reliable measurements--we often want to stack the signals to improve the signal to noise ratio so repeat "shots" must all have identical source energy characteristics.

4. A well-defined source signature is desirable. By this we mean that the exact pattern of the wave energy should be known. If it is, we can use deconvolution to find the exact times of reflections and/or refractions. Deconvolution is a processing step that enhances reflections and/or refractions.

Land Sources
------------

There are many ways of making the earth move suddenly so that seismic signals are generated, and their traveltimes can be recorded.

1. Explosives: To get good coupling the explosive should be detonated in a shallow shot hole. Explosives are generally not repeatable and may not be environmentally friendly.

2. Buffalo guns are common for small scale engineering / environmental work. See the figure for a diagram of this type of source.

3. A simple heavy hammer on a baseplate is inexpensive and safe for small jobs. When shear waves are required, a baseplate with ribs that penetrate the ground is used, and it is struck on it's side. This is a simple way to produce shear waves.

4. Finally, vibroseis is a more expensive source used mainly for reflection surveying. The input is a frequency varying sinusoid (called a chirp signal). Multiple vibrators are often used. There are systems ranging in size from handheld units like pavement packers through to massive special purpose trucks that can be used singly or in coupled groups to produce signals that penetrate beneath the crust into the mantle of the Earth.

    Diagram of a "Buffalo gun" seismic source. The 3/4 inch pipe with the shell installed is lowered into a borehole of the same size, then the steel drop rod is dropped through the tee so the firing pin strikes the 12 guage shell. This creates the seismic energy.

Water Sources
-------------

When seismic surveying is needed to characterize ocean, lake or river bed sediments, special sources of seismic energy are required. A few of these are listed here:

1. Air gun: Compressed air is released to the water, forming a bubble. As the bubble rises to the surface it pulsates creating an extended source signature.

2. Water gun: Water is ejected by a piston and there is a cavity behind the water jet. There is an implosion but no bubbles because no extra air has been introduced.

3. Sparkers: The electric charge held on a large bank of capacitors is discharged directly into the water. This ionizes the water and creates a plasma pulse. Voltages of ~4kV, and currents of ~200A are involved.

4. Boomers: These involve the discharge of capacitors through a coil.  The changing voltage impinges upon an aluminum plate and the interaction of the magnetic fields drives the plate backward.
