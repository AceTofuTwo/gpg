In resistivity surveying, information about the subsurface distribution of electrical conductivity is obtained by examining how currents flow in the earth. DC (direct current) resistivity methods involve injecting a steady state electrical current into the ground and observing the resulting distribution of potentials (voltages) at the surface or within boreholes.

Like all geophysical processes, DC surveys can be described in terms of input energy, the earth's physical properties, and signals or data that are measured.

Using the same colour scheme as the flow diagram above, Figure 2 shows how this conceptual framework applies for DC methods. The energy source is a pair of electrodes that inject a known current into the ground at known locations (Figure 2a). The earth affects this energy because variations in the electrical conductivity of subsurface structures will bend the current flow lines (Figure 2b). The measured signals or data (Figure 2c) will involve measurements of voltage at the earth's surface or within boreholes. This type of data contains information about how charges become distributed at boundaries where electrical conductivity changes.

For each placement of the transmitting electrodes, voltages will be measured at different locations. Therefore, the complete data set includes measured voltages with known currents and electrode geometries. In order to create maps or graphs of raw data for quality assessment, it is usual to convert the data into a form that has units of resistivity. The data are the input for DC resistivity inversions, and the results will be 1D, 2D or 3D models of how subsurface conductivity is distributed.


The physical property: electrical conductivity
==============================================

Electrical conductivity (or resistivity) is a bulk property of material describing how well that material allows electric currents to flow through it. Consider current flowing through the unit cube of material shown to the right: 

**Conductivity**, \\(\\sigma\\), is the inverse of resistivity: \\(\\sigma = 1/\\rho\\). Conductivity is given in units of Siemens per meter, or S/m. Millisiemens per meter (mS/m) are often used; 1000 mS/m = 1 S/m. So 1 mS/m = 1000 Ohm-m.


The electrical conductivity of Earth's materials varies over many orders of magnitude. It depends upon many factors, including: rock type, porosity, connectivity of pores, nature of the fluid, and metallic content of the solid matrix. An indication of the range of conductivity for rocks and minerals is in the following figure:

Soils and rocks are composed mostly of silicate minerals, which are essentially insulators. Exceptions include magnetite, specular hematite, carbon, graphite, pyrite, and pyrrhotite. Therefore conduction is largely electrolytic, so conductivity depends mainly upon:

	- porosity;
	- hydraulic permeability, which describes how pores are interconnected;
	- moisture content;
	- concentration of dissolved electrolytes;
	- temperature and phase of pore fluid;
	- amount and composition of colloids (clay content).
