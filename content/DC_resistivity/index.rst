In this section we look at Direct Current (DC) resistivity surveys. The
physical property of for DC surveys is electrical conductivity (or if you
like, resistivity). For these surveys, the source is current injected into the
ground, and the receivers measure the strength of the current and voltage
differences. Some key areas to pay attention to with DC surveys are the
various configurations (dipole-dipole, pole-dipole, gradient array,
Schumberger and Wenner soundings), each of which delivers a particular focus
on different subsurface information.
