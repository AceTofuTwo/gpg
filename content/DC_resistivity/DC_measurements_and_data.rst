DC resistivity: measurements and data
*************************************

Introduction
============

For DC resistivity surveys, the energy source is a generator which injects a constant current into the ground using two electrodes. The "signals out" (data) are voltages measured at various places on the surface, along with strength of the known current source (in Amperes) and details about relative geometry of the four electrodes.

In order to create maps or graphs of raw data for quality assessment or for direct interpretations, measurements are converted into a form that is related to the relevant physical property. For each measurement, a 3D version of Ohm's Law is used to generate a datum with units of resistivity (or condutivity). These transformed data are called apparent resistivities because they represent the earth's true resistivity only if the ground is uniform within range of the measurement. When subsurface resistivity varies, interpretation must be based upon the way in which **apparent resistivity** varies as a function of electrode geometry and position. The commonly used survey procedures are explained later on this page, after discussions about current flow, sources, measurements, and conversion to apparent resistivities.

Current flow in the ground
==========================

The path of the current in the earth after it is injected with two electrodes depends upon the distribution of electrical resistivity. If the Earth is uniform, current flows in a regular three dimensional pattern under the electrodes as illustrated Figure 1. The north slice number 8 (flagged with a *) is similar to the type of image commonly shown in texts to indicate how current flows in two dimensions under a pair of source electrodes.

Normally the earth is NOT uniform. Galvanic currents will flow towards regions of high conductivity and away from regions of high resistivity, as illustrated in Figure 2.
