Magnetic surveys
================

In geophysical magnetic surveying the Earth's magnetic field causes, or
induces, subsurface materials to become magnetized. Magnetic methods are used in wide range on problems:

 - visualization tool for geological mapping

        :scale: 100 %

 - parameter estimation for reclamation (UXO) and engineering work

 - 3D inversion for mineral exploration.

As summarized in :numref:`mag_response`, all applied geophysics
problems can be discussed in terms of (a) a source of energy that is put into the
ground, (b) the effects of this energy on the subsurface due to variations in the
relevant physical property and (c) the measurements that detect those changes to
the input energy.
Signals are interpreted in terms of the subsurface
distribution of the physical property, which in the case of magnetic surveys
is magnetic susceptibility.

The concept of magnetic surveying is illustrated in :numref:`mag_survey` In
this case, the **energy source** is the Earth's global magnetic field,
which has a strength and direction at every location on the Earth.
Subsurface materials become magnetized by this field,
and the data are measurements of the magnetic field at the Earth's
surface, in the air, in space, or within boreholes. The measured magnetic
field will be a superposition of Earth's field and the induced secondary
fields caused by magnetization of buried materials.
