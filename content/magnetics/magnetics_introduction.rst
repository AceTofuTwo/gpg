Introduction
************


The generic magnetic survey is summarized in :numref:`mag_response`.
The energy source is a magnetic field. The physical
property of interest is the magnetic susceptibility. The data
are also magnetic field values. 

Signals are interpreted in terms of the subsurface
distribution of the magnetc susceptibility.

A more pictoral summary of magnetic surveying is 
illustrated in :numref:`mag_survey` In
this case, the **energy source** is the Earth's global magnetic field,
which has a strength and direction at every location on the Earth.
Subsurface materials become magnetized by this field,
and the data are measurements of the magnetic field at the Earth's
surface, in the air, in space, or within boreholes. The measured magnetic
field will be a superposition of Earth's field and the induced secondary
fields caused by magnetization of buried materials. 
The end goal of a magnetic survey is to infer information about the 
sub-surface from the measured magnetic field data.

Magnetic data can be used in a variety of ways and for different purposes.
One of the most useful is to use magnetic data for geologic mapping.
The example below shows a magnetic map and a geologic  map over the 
same area. There are many geologic units that have a distinct magnetic
signature but the correspondence in not one-to-one.

Magnetic data can be used for remediation  and engineering work. The
image below shows the magnetic data over an area that is contaminated by
UXO. Each UXO has a signature like that of a magnetic dipole but the
orientations are random. These data provide fairly localized information
about where to dig to find the ordnance item. However, the data can
be further analysed through a parameteric inversion to find the
location in 3D space and also the size of the object. These are
valuable pieces of information when the area is being reclaimed.

Magnetic data are also routinely used in mineral exploration.
In this application however, the data must be inverted to recover
information about the structure of the deposit at depth. The ability
to extend surface information into depth is one of the most
valuable results to be obtained from geophysical data.
