Magnetic surveys
================

In geophysical magnetic surveying the Earth's magnetic field causes, or
induces, subsurface materials to become magnetized. Referring to the following
three-component outline, all applied geophysics problems can be discussed in
terms of a source of energy that is put into the ground, the effects on that
energy due to subsurface variations in the relevant physical property, and the
measurements that detect those changes to the input energy. Signals are
interpreted in terms of the subsurface distribution of the physical property,
which in the case of magnetic surveys is magnetic susceptibility.

Using the same colour scheme as the figure above, Figures 2a - 2e illustrate
how this concept applies to magnetic surveys. In this case, the **energy
source** is Earth's global magnetic field (Figure 2a) which has a strength and
direction at every location on the Earth (Figure 2b). Subsurface materials
(Figure 2c) become magnetized by this field (Figure 2d), and the data (Figure
2e) are measurements of the magnetic field at the Earth's surface, in the air,
in space, or within boreholes. The measured magnetic field will be a
superposition of Earth's field and the induced secondary fields caused by
magnetization of buried materials.
