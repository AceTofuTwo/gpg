Recall that the anomaly pattern recorded over any given target depends upon
latitude, target orientation, profile orientation, remanent magnetization of
the target, and possible superposition of adjacent targets. To illustrate,
here we show the anomaly recorded over two dykes buried at different depths.
The dykes are assumed to extend to very great distances into and out of the
page (they are 2D targets), and north is to the right (you are looking west),
except in figure 3. The sketch to the right illustrates the situation. The
figures below show how data over these dykes will depend on latitude, line
orientation, target orientation, and so on. On the graph of the line profile
data, note the changes in vertical scale as well as the changes in shape of
the graph.
