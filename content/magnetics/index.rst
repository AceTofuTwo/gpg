This section covers some of the basic information regarding magnetics. For magnetic surveys, the physical property of concern is magnetic susceptibility, which is a measure of how magnetized a material becomes in the presence of a magnetic field. The source for a magnetic field survey is the natural magnetic field of the earth, and there are a variety of receivers that measure both the earth’s field and the induced field in buried objects. Because magnetic fields are vector quantities, the character of our measurements depends upon our location in the earth’s surface, so we will look at different ways to plot the earth’s magnetic field and investigate how our position on the earth affects the way we interpret our measurements.
