This section covers some basic information for magnetic surveys. The physical property of concern is magnetic susceptibility, which is a measure of how magnetized a material becomes in the presence of a magnetic field. The source for a magnetic  survey is the natural magnetic field of the earth. It is shown schematically in the accompanying photo.  Receivers measure either the amplitude of the magnetic field or one or more of its components. The earth's field changes with latitude and longitude and hence magnetic surveys, carried out over the same  geologic structure or buried object, will generate different data at different locations on the earth. In this module we present basic material for understanding the magnetic survey, how the data are processed and how they can be interpreted.
