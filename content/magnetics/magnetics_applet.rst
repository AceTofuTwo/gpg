The response that will be measured at points on a surface overlying a buried
magnetic dipole can be explored using the UBC-GIF magnetic dipole magnetic_app_. Be sure to read the documentation provided in the notebook before using it. This tool allows you to vary the location and shape of a buried 3D prism and get the surface map of the anomalous magnetic. The app also allows to include a remanent  (permanent magnet) component to the total magnetization model. Changing the size and location of the prism allows the simulation of a wide range of scenarios, from vertical pipe <add case study here> to various kinds of :ref:`plate models<magnetics_extended_bodies>`.
