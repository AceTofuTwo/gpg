Interpretation
**************

.. DWO:   this section can benefit with additional development and figures.

There are numerous options for processing potential fields data in general,
and magnetics data specifically. One example is shown below. The processing was applied in
this case in order to emphasize geologic structural trends.

Other examples of magnetic data processing techniques include:

- Upward continuation is commonly used to remove the effects of very nearby
  (or shallow) susceptible material.

- Second vertical derivative of total field anomaly is sometimes used to
  emphasize the edges of anomalous zones.

- Reduction to the pole rotates the data set so that it appears as if the
  geology existed at the north magnetic pole. This removes the asymmetry
  associated with mid-latitude anomalies.

- Calculating the pseudo-gravity anomaly converts the magnetic data into a
  form that would appear if buried sources were simply density anomalies
  rather than dipolar sources.

- Horizontal gradient of pseudo-gravity anomaly: gravity anomaly inflection
  points (horizontal gradient peaks) align with vertical body boundaries;
  therefore, mapping peaks of horizontal gradient of pseudo-gravity can help
  map geologic contacts.

The effects of these five processing options are illustrated in a `separate
sidebar`_ on processing of magnetics data.
